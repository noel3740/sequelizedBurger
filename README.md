# Eat Da Burger

This is a mobile friendly burger logger built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap, JQuery and a homemade ORM (yum!). This application follows the MVC design pattern. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data into app, and Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

* `Eat Da Burger` is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the `Burgers to eat` area waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the `Burgers to eat` area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the `Burgers devoured` area.
* The app will store every burger in a `mySQL` database.
